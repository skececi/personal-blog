summary: 'AI is going to make the cost of software trend to zero. But how? And when?'
---

Over the weekend, I saw the claim: "Soon, the cost of making software will be zero." A bold claim (one where the word "soon" does a lot of heavy lifting), but I agree. In my own time spent coding, I can build things much faster.

But I've always had a bit of a grudge against these "pundits" who make claims from afar about trends in software -- almost like the out of touch general sending troops into certain death. 

What is it that *actually* makes the cost of software go down? It certainly can't be talking about it.

The moment of clarity for me occurred when I was watching [Dwarkesh's great interview with Tyler Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT_sXIUJPUo). The title basically gives away the thesis: "The #1 Bottleneck to AI Progress is Humans."

I evaluate this in two ways:
1. Most people like to make bold claims and then sit around and wait for them to come true. Others make the claims come true via effort and talent.
2. AI inherently is a multiplier (not a summation) on human labor. What that means, in plain terms, is that someone (a human!) still needs to get up and do the damn thing! 
   1. Anyone who has spent longer than 10 minutes with LLM agents knows they need a capable, very hands-on driver. The quality of LLM output is extremely connected to how well you prompt it. 
   2. It's a multiplier on your workrate and intellect!

Fueled by these relelations, I sought to chip away at the wall of software not being free. So I made something for free.

Below is the README of the repo I made which strives to actually do a small piece of this. Check out the code and use it for whatever you want – it's free!

# What + Why
The cost of making a GPT wrapper just dropped to zero.

You've heard the following thesis echoed everywhere: “The cost of software is trending to zero.” And then, a subset of that: “GPT Wrappers are adding 0 value”.

I agree… Sort of. The thing is, saying these things outloud or tweeting about them is not what makes cost trend to zero. It’s actually creating the thing and giving it away for free that makes the cost zero.

Let’s say you want to build a ChatGPT clone or integrate LLM Chat into your product.
From my Google searching, several things exist:
- Copies of ChatGPT, but not open source (?) ([\[1\]](https://t3.chat/) [\[2\]](https://chat.thunderlink.me/))
- Paid libraries/starterkits ([\[1\]](https://enhanceui.gumroad.com/l/chatgpt-template-starter-kit), [\[2\]](https://github.com/horizon-ui/chatgpt-ai-template), [\[3\]](https://letsremote.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/8aea640f-0ea4-42c6-a171-8624e59198d4?discount=100))
- Free frontend only UIs (e.g. SillyTavern)
- Free backend only frameworks/libraries

What I cannot find is a very simple way to create a fullstack chatbot starter, batteries included. I’m pretty good at Googling, and I couldn’t find anything. So I figured there’s nothing quite right.

I find a lot of value in **Project Starter Kits**. These are usually GitHub repos that you fork/clone, and then build from as a starting point. They also take the form cmdline solutions like `create-react-app`, `npm create vite@latest`, Django's `startproject`, etc.

Suffice it to say: The goal of this repo is to drive the cost of creating a basic chatbot to zero. You can create a GPT wrapper in ~10 minutes using this repo. Or integrate it into your existing application. Since this is free + MIT licensed— the cost to create a GPT wrapper is now zero. Fork it, host it and charge money, or just copy/paste the code.

Surely this means no one will ever have to do this again ;\) — cue XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927
