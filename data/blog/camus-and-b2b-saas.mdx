In high school, my french teacher made us read Camus. Specifically, we read L'Etranger in french. I didn't understand it. 

To be clear, it had nothing to do with the fact that it was in french. I simply didn't understand it. At all.

Years later (8 to be exact), my coworker posted a video titled "Microservices":

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8OnoxKotPQ"
  title="Microservices"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

I love this video. On the surface, I love it because it speaks very clearly to the hilarity of working in a tech company, dealing with corporate jargon, and weird internal politics.

But after watching it a few more times, I love it for another reason. I love it because it's Absurd.
